🎓 Placement Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a student will be placed or not based on academic and skill-related factors such as CGPA and IQ. Using Python and machine learning algorithms, it demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation steps in a Jupyter Notebook.

📂 Dataset

File: placement.csv

Description: Contains student details and placement status.

Key Features:

cgpa – Student’s CGPA

iq – Student’s IQ score

placement – Target variable (1 = Placed, 0 = Not Placed)

⚙️ Project Workflow

Data Loading & Exploration – Load and inspect dataset structure.

Data Visualization – Analyze trends and correlations.

Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values and prepare features.

Model Building – Train ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree).

Evaluation – Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Prediction – Predict placement for new student data.

🧠 Technologies Used

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, joblib

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Dhiraj792/Placement-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning


Navigate to the project directory

cd placement-prediction-ml


Open project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

Run all cells to train, test, and evaluate the model.

(Optional) Edit input values to make custom placement predictions.

📈 Results

Model achieves good accuracy on the test data.

Visualization clearly shows how CGPA and IQ impact placement chances.

Easy to extend with additional features or new algorithms.
